# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of common **data structures** using the C++ programming language.  
It was created for educational purposes to help understand how different data structures work internally â€” including their logic, memory handling, and performance behavior.

## Contents

The repository includes the following data structures:

- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List  
  - Doubly Linked List  

- **Stacks**
  - Array-Based Stack  
  - Linked List Stack  

- **Queues**
  - Circular Queue (Array)  
  - Linked Queue  
  - Queue Using Two Stacks  

- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree  
  - Binary Search Tree  

- **Other Implementations**
  - Array-Based List  
  - Infix to Postfix Conversion  
  - Expression Evaluation  

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:
- Provide clear and simple C++ implementations of fundamental data structures.  
- Demonstrate how each structure works internally without relying on STL containers.  
- Serve as a learning reference for students and developers studying **data structures and algorithms**.
